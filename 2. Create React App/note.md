# Create React App
1. npx create-react-app <App Name> (Old Way / Slow)
2. npm create vite@latest (New / Fast)


*Vite* is a bundler. BUndler is a tool to combine all the files into a single file.
So When We React In Project, It has Many Files. *vite* bundles all the files into a single file.


#  Problem With npx create-react-app
It's Slow. Because When we intiliaze the project with npx create-react-app it takes a lot of time. It Install Lot Of Extra Dependencies.
So We Use *Vite* Instead
